*******************************************************************************************************************
</p>

Please make sure that you have :

 - Opencv (I used 4.5.2)
 - Qt (I used 5.12)
 - DCMTK (I used 3.6.4)
 
 installed on the computer and configured to be detected when building the project. (If you use windows make sure to configure your 
 libraries directories and binaries directories in your environment variable path to make things easy for you !!).
 
 Please create a build file next to the other folders, and build the project there. After that make the project in the 
 mainExecute folder that is going to be created, to create the executable file.
